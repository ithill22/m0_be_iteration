# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    - with the standard .each method I feel quite comfortable. It took me some time to figure out how to incorporate .length but was able to figure it out eventually.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - The assignments that require us to do our own research are my favorite so far. I may not always get the right answer but it is very engaging. Definitely a productive struggle at times.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I feel pretty comfortable with what we have learned so far. Just need the repitition to hammer it into my head.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    -No questions now but i have plenty of resources if they arise. Small team, friends, pairings, google and the teachers!
